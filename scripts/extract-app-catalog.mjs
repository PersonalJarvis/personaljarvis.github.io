/**
 * The application's own catalogs, lifted into this repository as one file.
 *
 * The three detail pages — /plugins, /skills, /clis — are a listing of what
 * the product actually ships: twenty-four plugins, twenty-two command-line
 * tools and thirty built-in skills, each with the description, the sign-in
 * mode, the risk tier and the trigger patterns the app itself carries. Every
 * one of those is a fact that changes with the product, and a hand-typed copy
 * of seventy-six entries is a copy nobody re-checks. The site's rule is that
 * nothing on it is invented; the only way to hold that at this size is to read
 * the source and commit what came back.
 *
 * ## Why it is committed rather than read at build time
 *
 * This repository is its own git repo. A clone of it on a machine that has no
 * checkout of the application still has to build the site — so the data is a
 * file in `src/data/`, exactly like `stargazers.json` and `social-counts.json`,
 * and this script is the thing that refreshes it when the product moves.
 *
 * ## What it reads
 *
 *   jarvis/marketplace/seed_catalog.json     the plugin catalog
 *   jarvis/clis/catalog/seed_catalog.json    the command-line tool catalog
 *   jarvis/skills/builtin/<name>/SKILL.md    one file per built-in skill
 *
 * The application checkout is found at `--repo <path>`, then `$JARVIS_REPO`,
 * then the parent directory of this one — which is where it sits in the
 * maintainer's working copy.
 *
 * ## Degrading honestly
 *
 * A run that cannot find the application, or that finds a catalog it does not
 * recognise, leaves the committed file exactly as it is and exits non-zero. It
 * never writes a partial catalog: half a listing is worse than a month-old one,
 * because the page cannot tell the reader which half it is.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/extract-app-catalog.mjs [--repo <path>] [--verbose]
 * Exit:   0 written or unchanged, 1 could not read the application
