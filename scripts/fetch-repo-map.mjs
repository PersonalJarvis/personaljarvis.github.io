/**
 * The repository, as GitHub itself describes it — for the open-source section's
 * walkthrough.
 *
 * ## Why this is fetched and committed rather than written by hand
 *
 * The section draws a repository browser: three directory listings and the top
 * of one file, with the repository's own description, topics, licence and
 * counts beside them. Every one of those is a fact about a repository that
 * changes, and a hand-typed copy is a claim nobody re-checks. The site's rule
 * is that nothing on it is invented, and the only way to keep that true for a
 * listing of sixty-four entries is to read it from the source and commit what
 * came back.
 *
 * It is committed rather than fetched in the browser for the same reason the
 * social counts are: the page must be complete before any JavaScript runs, and
 * the tree API is not a call to spend on every visitor.
 *
 * ## What it reads
 *
 *   GET /repos/{repo}                      description, topics, licence, counts
 *   GET /repos/{repo}/contents/            the root listing
 *   GET /repos/{repo}/contents/jarvis      the application package
 *   GET /repos/{repo}/contents/install     the installer directory
 *   GET /repos/{repo}/contents/install/install.ps1   the head of one file
 *   GET /repos/{repo}/commits?per_page=1   the tip commit, for the listing head
 *
 * All five are public and anonymous. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used when it is in the
 * environment — it only raises the rate limit, and the script is a supported,
 * green run without one.
 *
 * ## Degrading honestly
 *
 * A run that cannot reach GitHub leaves the committed file exactly as it is and
 * exits non-zero. It never writes a partial map: half a listing is worse than a
 * month-old one, because the page cannot tell the reader which half it is.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/fetch-repo-map.mjs [--verbose]
 * Exit:   0 written or unchanged, 1 could not read GitHub
