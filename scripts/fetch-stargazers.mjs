/**
 * Where the people who starred Personal Jarvis are, as points on a globe.
 *
 * ## Why this runs at build time and not in the browser
 *
 * The star COUNT is public and anonymous: one unauthenticated request, which
 * the page makes for itself so the number is live to the minute.
 *
 * Where those people ARE is a different question. The REST API gives you a
 * list of logins and nothing else, so a location costs one more request per
 * person — 60 an hour is the anonymous ceiling, and a page that spends it on
 * the first visitor leaves the second one staring at an error. GraphQL hands
 * back login and location together, 100 people to a request, but it refuses to
 * answer without a token, and a token in a static page is a token anyone can
 * read out of the bundle.
 *
 * So the map is drawn here, where a token is safe, and the result is committed.
 * A scheduled workflow re-runs it and the site rebuilds; see
 * `.github/workflows/stargazers.yml`.
 *
 * ## What ships
 *
 * Counts per place. No logins, no profile URLs, no dates, nothing that names a
 * person. "Three people in Berlin" is the whole claim the section makes, and
 * it is the whole thing this file writes. People star a repository; they do
 * not agree to be pinned to a map by name.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/fetch-stargazers.mjs [--repo owner/name]
 * Auth:   $GITHUB_TOKEN, $GH_TOKEN, or a signed-in `gh` CLI
 * Writes: src/data/stargazers.json
