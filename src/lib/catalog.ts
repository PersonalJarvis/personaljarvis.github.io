/**
 * The application's catalogs, typed — and worded the way the application words
 * them.
 *
 * `src/data/app-catalog.json` is machine-written from the product's own source
 * (see `scripts/extract-app-catalog.mjs`). This file is the only place that
 * turns its ids into English, and the English is the APPLICATION'S, copied from
 * the running views rather than composed here:
 *
 *   - the three sign-in modes are `AUTH_MODE_LABEL` in `PluginsView.tsx`
 *   - the three sign-in lifetimes are its `LONGEVITY_LABEL`
 *   - the four risk tiers are `RiskTier` in `jarvis/clis/spec.py`
 *
 * That matters more than it looks. A visitor who reads this page and then
 * installs the product should find the same words on the same rows; a site that
 * invents friendlier ones has described a product that does not exist. Where a
 * label needs a sentence of explanation the site adds one — the `hint` beside
 * each label — but the label itself is never rewritten.
 *
 * The detail pages import from here and never reach into the JSON directly, so
 * a shape change in the catalog is a compile error in one file.
