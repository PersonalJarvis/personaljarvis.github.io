/**
 * The site nav's links — the one list, in page order.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in the component for the same reason the widths do:
 * the nav is not the only thing that has to agree with it. The scroll-spy reads
 * the same ids to decide which link is current, and a second hand-written copy
 * of the list is a copy that goes stale the moment a section is renamed,
 * reordered or removed — silently, because a link to an id that no longer
 * exists still renders and simply does nothing.
 *
 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING, not cosmetic. The spy resolves the current section by
 * walking this list and taking the LAST entry whose section has crossed under
 * the nav, so the entries have to be in the order the sections appear in
 * `src/pages/index.astro`. A misordered entry does not break the jump; it
 * lights the wrong link on the way past, which is harder to notice and harder
 * to attribute.
 *
 * NOT EVERY SECTION IS IN HERE. The hero is the top of the page and the
 * wordmark already goes there; the logo strip is a band the reader passes
 * THROUGH rather than one they navigate to; the install steps have the whole
 * Download button to themselves; and the legal foot is the end of the page,
 * which is one End key away. Everything a reader might want to be sent to IS
 * here, in page order.
 *
 * THAT WAS NOT TRUE UNTIL 2026-08-29. Three sections were added to the page
 * over the course of one afternoon — the stargazer globe, the open-source walk
 * and the legal foot — and the nav, whose list is this file, kept the shape it
 * had before any of them existed. Only `open-source` was added with it; the
 * globe and the build-in-public gallery, which had been on the page since the
 * morning, were left off on the theory that nobody navigates to social proof.
 * The maintainer's answer, on seeing the shipped nav, was that the sections
 * belong in it. WHEN A SECTION IS ADDED TO `index.astro`, IT IS ADDED HERE IN
 * THE SAME CHANGE unless one of the four reasons above applies to it.

 * confirms when the reader lands on it.
 *
 * THE ROW IS WIDTH-CONSTRAINED AND THIS LIST IS WHY. Seven section links, the
 * Docs link, the wordmark and the Download button share one `content` row, and
 * the row has no way to say it is full — flex simply pushes the wordmark and
 * the button towards each other until the labels run out through the Download
 * button. Seven entries need 977px of row and the two additions of 2026-08-29
 * cost 180px of that, which is why the links' gap steps down below 1280px (56px
 * back, bringing the row to 921px) and why the links are put away below 1024px
 * rather than below 768px — both in `layout.css`, with the arithmetic. ADDING A
 * NINTH ENTRY MEANS MEASURING AGAIN AT 1024px, not just typing a line here.
