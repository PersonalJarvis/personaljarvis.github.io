/**
 * The CLIs demo script.
 *
 * Read out of the app and then checked a second time against the source. Four
 * things the adversarial pass threw out, all of them plausible:
 *
 *  - A hand-picked row order. The API sorts by (category, display_name), so
 *    GitHub CLI is roughly the eleventh row, not the first.
 *  - The risk badge "monitor" beside `gh pr list --state open`. `monitor` is
 *    the CLI's DEFAULT tier; the gate resolves per command, and gh's whitelist
 *    contains `gh pr list*`, so this exact command comes back `safe`. Pairing
 *    it with "monitor" would misstate the product's own safety gate — and it
 *    is the more interesting claim anyway: a read command is auto-downgraded.
 *  - A green safe badge. Nothing in the app's risk styles is green; safe is the
 *    quietest grey of the four.
 *  - "Target:" as a label on the CLI picker. No such string exists.
 *
 * Everything below — binary, commands, auth mode, tier, blocked and allowed
 * patterns, the example call — is verbatim from jarvis/clis/catalog/seed_catalog.json.
 * The connection statuses are this machine's runtime state, not catalog facts.
