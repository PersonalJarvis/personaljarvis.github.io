/**
 * The plugins demo script.
 *
 * The list is the app's whole shipped catalog — all twenty-four, in the order
 * the catalog serves them, because a header reading "24 available" over five
 * rows reads as a broken list rather than a short one. The window shows about
 * seven at a time and scrolls, exactly as the app does.
 *
 * Marks come from `src/assets/brands/`, bundled at build time, so the demo makes
 * no network call — which docs/feature-section.md forbids. Two of the
 * twenty-four are not bundled: Stripe and Cloudflare publish no square
 * full-colour icon, and their real app icon IS a white glyph on the brand
 * colour, so the tinted fallback is the faithful rendering rather than a
 * placeholder.
 *
 * Connection status is this machine's runtime state, not a catalog fact.
