/**
 * The repository walkthrough — the click path, and the repository it walks.
 *
 * Four beats of one visit to github.com/PersonalJarvis/PersonalJarvis: the
 * root, the application package, the installer directory, and the first lines
 * of the installer itself. It is the path a careful visitor actually takes
 * before running an install one-liner, which is the whole argument the section
 * around it makes.
 *
 * ## Nothing here is written by hand
 *
 * Every listing, the description, the topics, the licence, the counts, the tip
 * commit and the eighteen lines of source come out of `src/data/repo-map.json`,
 * which `scripts/fetch-repo-map.mjs` reads from GitHub's API and commits. A
 * hand-typed listing of sixty-four entries is a claim nobody re-checks, and
 * this page's rule is that nothing on it is invented. What IS decided here is
 * the path — which three directories are opened, in which order.
 *
 * ## The sort is ours, and it has to be
 *
 * The contents API returns one alphabetical run with directories and files
 * mixed together; github.com lists every directory first and then every file.
 * Drawing the API's order would draw a listing no visitor has ever seen at that
 * URL, so the order is rebuilt here — see `ordered`.

 * the pointer on beat two rests on the breadcrumb that makes the first of them.
 * Spending a whole beat on the root a second time would buy nothing but

 * beat is the payoff: the file the section's headline promises, held longest
 * because it is the only frame with something to READ.
